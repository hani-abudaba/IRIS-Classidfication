The Iris flower data set, initially introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936, serves as a multivariate dataset exemplifying linear discriminant analysis. It is alternatively referred to as Fisher's Iris data set or Anderson's Iris data set, named after its collector Edgar Anderson. This dataset's historical context and its subsequent controversy in the realm of statistical education have led to discussions about its ongoing relevance.
Comprising 50 samples from each of three Iris species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor), the dataset encompasses measurements of four attributes from each sample: sepal and petal length and width, all recorded in centimeters. Fisher harnessed the amalgamation of these attributes to develop a linear discriminant model, enabling the differentiation of the distinct Iris species from one another.
